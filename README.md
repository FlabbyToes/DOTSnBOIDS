![Unity DOTS Boids](https://github.com/ahuliangbo/DOTSnBOIDS/blob/main/boids.gif)

**Unity DOTS Boids** is a simple project that implements a high-performance Boids simulation using Unity's Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS). By leveraging the power of DOTS, this simulation can handle an extreme number of Boids with impressive efficiency.

## Features

- **Unity DOTS**: Utilizes Unity Entity Component System, multithreaded job system, and Burst compiler for optimal performance

- **Boids Algorithm**: Implements classic Boids behaviors: separation, alignment, and cohesion,  as well as obstacle avoidance.

- **Extreme Optimization**: 10,000+ boids with obstacle detection at 60+ FPS on mid-range hardware, around 30x faster than standard Unity
